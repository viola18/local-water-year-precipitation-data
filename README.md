Total annual precipitation data used for making the maps

This dataset includes the total annual precipitation (TAP) values for 3,000 randomly selected lakes (out of 479,950 lakes) across the CONUS. The data were calculated using the monthly precipitation data from calendar years 2008 to 2018 from the LAGOS-US GEO module (Smith et al. 2022). We assigned each of these lakes a local water year (LWY) end month according to the HU4 area they are located in (i.e., all the lakes in the same HU4 area share the same end month), and the annual precipitation was calculated based on the LWY timeframe. We also calculated the lake-specific TAP based on the USGS water year (which ends on September 30th). For both timeframes, the water year is named by the calendar year in which it ends.
